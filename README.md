# STARMAPs
STARMAPs: a Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns

STARMAPs is a statistical tool for a comparison between two microbiota datasets. It provides inference for alike and opposite matchings of the microbial changes associated with treatments/factors in two different datasets. 

# Implementation
STARMAPs is currently implemented as an R source file ("STARMAPs_v1.R"), which will be coded into an R package.
